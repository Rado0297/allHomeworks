Create an “Online Map Tourism” application using Google maps
Choose 10 capital cities from the world
Make two buttons for “Next” and “Previous” which should iterate through the cities
When one of the buttons is clicked, map should pan to the new location of the new city
Each city should have Infobox with more information about it on the map
Show lists of the cities on the page. If the user chooses a city, the map should pan directly to it
